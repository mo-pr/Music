# I. PROJECT SUMMARY
## WHY WE DO THIS
 We do it because we like to and we are very interested in html and so on and it is very nice to make something others could use with the knowledge you made it.
## WHAT WE DO
We do a web application about music we got a chatroom there so everybody could chat with other lovers of music. We do it with a log in so everybody could make his/her own account.
## HOW WE DO IT
We do it with the same editors and the same browser to eliminate errors with different applications and mostly we talk about discord.
## TEAM
Me and my partner Moritz are doing this project we are a group of two buddies.
## WHERE WE WORK
Mostly at school but now at this time we work from home with our own github resoporitory and we talk over discord.
## HOW LONG IT TAKES
It may takes us a few weeks to finish it but we always learn new way to make it more efficient but all in all we are mostly finished.

# II. PROJECT METHODOLOGY
## THE PROJECT AND MANAGMENT
This project is about a web application for music. It includes some informations about music festivals and genres and the chatroom with the log in is for all the music lovers who want to talk to other lovers about their experience at festivals or something else may be feelings they get when they are listening to something special. We mostly work at Wednesday and Thursday and we use the same editors and browser to make less errors. But if we got errors at the run time with our application we mostly talk to our partner how we could fix this and ask the person who made this part how he made it this is very easy in a team of two.
## TASK BREAKDOWN
We are mostly finished with our application so we don’t got many tasks left. The tasks we got left are the genres and some design things that approximately take us all in all about a hour max. two hours.
## DELIVEREABLES
We are expecting that our web app is giving informations about music and types of music and festivals and other things that have to to with thing for or about music.

# IV. CLOSING
## CONCLUSION
 Our project is the best idea because we give our visitors informations and more knowledge that have to do with music and its also for your leisure through the chatroom and with the registration we could get more customers and then we could make collaborations for example with spotify where our customers could pay us money with a premium account to discuss with others about music or to an explicit song or something and this project got a lot of potential.
